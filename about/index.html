        <h1>I'm Arne, and this is my site.</h1>
        <p>It's pretty bare bones, just like I want it. I plan to fill it out with posts about the programming I do. Maybe tutorials. Maybe something else. </p>
        <h2>What sort of programming do I do?</h2>
        <p>Right now I occupy myself by developing a <a href="https://duck.place">browser game</a>. You can check out some of my other projects at my <a href="https://github.com/ArneStenkrona">github</a>. </p>
        <h2>Do I do anything else?</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineer by trade. I have way too much computing in my life. </p>
