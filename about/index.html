        <h1>I'm Arne, and this is my site.</h1>
        <p>It's pretty bare bones, just like I want it. I plan to fill it out with posts about the programming I do. Maybe tutorials. Maybe something else. </p>
        <h2>What sort of programming do I do?</h2>
        <p>Right now I'm stuck developing my toy <a href="https://github.com/ArneStenkrona/prototype2">game engine</a>. I use this engine as an excuse to implement whatever things I find interesting. To date this has been everything from custom memory allocators to skinning animation. I plan on doing write-ups on some of these techniques in order to share the insights I gained from their implementation. </p>
        <h2>Do I do anything else?</h2>
        <p>I'm studying computer science at Lund University, Sweden. Besides computers I have a heavy interest in the artistic both visually, sonically, and mentally. </p>
