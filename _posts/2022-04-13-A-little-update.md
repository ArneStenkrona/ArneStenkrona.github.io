With a grand total of 1 posts in over a year it is safe to say that I don't really post much here. There is good reason for it. Over the past year my spare time has been consumed by one single project. It's a browser game where you get to build your own levels. It takes clear, unabashed inspiration from Mario. You can check it out at <a href="https://duck.place">duck.place</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since I'm documenting the progress in a devlog, all the time I allocate to writing ends up being about this game as well. So continue to expect few updates on this site and check out the <a href="https://duck.place/devlog">duck.place devlog</a> if you want to keep up with what I'm working on.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I'll write something here. I actually have a post about block allocators that I've yet to finish. Maybe I will finish it in another year.
